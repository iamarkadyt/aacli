# Notice

To everyone who's starred this repo in the last 24 hours, it's been initially called `aacli` but was later renamed to `aws-auth`. I'm currently in the process of updating it on `npm` registry, so right now the installation intstructions below don't work. It's expected to be fixed later today (by evening, CST time). Thank you all for the patience!

# What is this?

This CLI tool allows you to programmatically authenticate into AWS accounts through IAM roles in a multi-account [AWS organization](https://github.com/iamarkadyt/aws-auth/blob/master/DEVOPS.md) setup. It supports session management, stores all AWS credentials in an encrypted file and by default only grants AWS access through environment variable injection and subprocessing to avoid storing credentials on disk in plain text.

It supports and __requires__ MFA authentication which, combined with using AWS access credentials produced by authentication through IAM roles (temporary by design), makes it a secure and convenient way to authenticate into AWS. This means that when you authenticate into an AWS environment (AWS account) with this CLI, libraries like [aws sdk](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tools-sdks/), [aws cdk](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/), [aws cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), [aws shell](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-shell), [aws sam](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/), [rclone](https://rclone.org/) __and any software dependent on them__, like custom deployment scripts or tools or any other scripts that access AWS, __obtain programmatic access to AWS resources__ located in that AWS account.

Here's a usage demo for a quick taste:

Notice how we never have to leave the terminal window or manually manipulate AWS credentials on the computer to switch between AWS accounts. This CLI provides a toolset for convenient and secure way of accessing AWS resources, managing AWS credentials and temporary sessions, and an easy way for rapid switching of roles and environments as needed.

# Installation

To install this CLI, run:
```
npm install -g @iamarkadyt/aws-auth
```

# Usage

### Workflow

First, let's cover the basic workflow.
1. If you're using this CLI for the first time, you'll have to first configure it. Use `aws-auth config` command to do that. You will be asked to provide HUB account credentials in this step, as well as environment configuration JSON. We cover HUB accounts and enviornment configuration in more detail in the next section.
2. Once configured, use `aws-auth login` to create temporary AWS access sessions. This is the part that adds most security to this authentication flow as it requires MFA to create these temporary sessions, and AWS credentials obtained through this process expire in 1 hour by default (automatic rotation).
3. Once logged in, use `aws-auth run` command to invoke other commands in your terminal with AWS access. A few quick examples: `aws-auth run -- aws s3 ls` or `aws-auth run -- ./deploy-my-app.js`.

### More on configuration

During the first initialization of the config you will be asked to provide a passphrase. It will be used to encrypt the store that will hold all your AWS credentials. To change the encryption passphrase use `aws-auth crypto` command.

#### What is an "environment configuration"?

An environment configuration is a JSON array holding information about any downstream AWS environments (AWS accounts) that are available for authentication into. For example you may have a `dev` environment with following configuration:

```
{
    "environments": [
        {
            "name": "dev",
            "accountId": "12312312312",
            "region": "us-east-1",
            "roles": [ "DEVELOPER", "ADMIN", "READONLY" ]
        }
    ]
}
```

This configuration lets `aws-auth` know that there is an environment named `dev` with an account ID of `12312312312` located in `us-east-1` region that has 3 roles available for assumption.

Usually, at work, this configuration should be created, maintained and provided to you by the DevOps team. You would only need to paste it into this CLI to complete the configuration.

#### What is a HUB account?

A HUB account is the root account in the HUB-and-SPOKE multi-account setup that holds IAM users with permissions restricted to only one action -- `sts:AssumeRole`. Users obtain permanent credentials from this account and use them to assume roles in downstream accounts which may be named `dev`, `stage`, `prod`, etc. More information on this multi-account setup and how to implement it can be found in [DEVOPS.md](https://github.com/iamarkadyt/aws-auth/blob/master/DEVOPS.md).

Briefly, benefits of this setup are:
- All business resources are stored in downstream AWS accounts. HUB account only controls governance and access management.
- There is isolation between downstream environments which enhances network and access security, reduces blast radius in case of a breach, and allows for nice organization and separation of AWS resources.
- Access to AWS resources is granted through IAM role assumption which requires MFA and returns auto-expiring temporary AWS credentials.

It's important to note that this CLI was built around this multi-account model in the first place. You don't have to follow it, but it's HIGHLY recommended to do so. You can still use this CLI even if you have just 1 AWS account. The only required things are accessing AWS resources through role assumption and using MFA. Again, more details on how to implement this setup can be found in [DEVOPS.md](https://github.com/iamarkadyt/aws-auth/blob/master/DEVOPS.md).

#### What are profiles?

Profiles provide a convenient way to have multiple separate global configurations. An example use case is having `work` and `personal` profiles, where `work` holds credentials and environment configuration provided by the organization you may work for and `personal` holds configuration for your personal AWS accounts that you use for your side projects.

### More on authentication

Once the configuration file is created you can start authenticating into downstream AWS environments through `aws-auth login` command. Successful authentication creates an active session that is securely stored in CLI configuration files. You can have multiple active sessions at the same time, and you can also use `aws-auth unauth` command to revoke them all (erases all temporary AWS credentials from disk).

An existing active session can be used with `aws-auth run` command to execute a subcommand under a specified IAM role. Sessions have names that follow pattern of `profile/environment/role`. When you run `aws-auth run` command it presents a list of all existing active sessions that you can choose from to use for the provided subcommand. Run command signature is `aws-auth run -- <subcommand>`, an example invocation is `aws-auth run -- aws s3 ls`. Run command injects credentials into the subcommand passed after `--` sign through environment variables. Here's a full list of variables injected:
```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
```

Here's a demo:

### Other commands

Other available commands are:

- `aws-auth reset` -- Deletes CLI configuration files. Might come useful if you decided to erase all configuration to start from scratch.
- `aws-auth web` -- Opens up a browser tab to authenticate you into the selected AWS environment in AWS web console.

# Project goals

This project was born from an effort to figure out a _simple_ yet _reasonably secure_ way of _programmatic_ authentication into AWS environments _with support for MFA authentication_.

The regular approach taken by many software companies is either:

- Using expensive SSO solutions (3rd party single sign-on SaaS platforms) and writing custom CLI toolkits for integrating with said platforms for programmatic AWS access (early and unnecessary complexity,  financial and development time costs).
- Or not using any MFA at all and just using plain permanent AWS IAM user credentials (terribly insecure).

This project aims to provide a secure and efficient alternative solution to both of these options. It's a great tool for bootstrappers or any early-stage software startup built on AWS, that is not yet ready to invest into solutions like Okta which cost thousands of dollars in upfront costs (annual contract minimums) but want to have a great day-to-day cloud operations security to keep the attack surface of their digital business to a minimum.
