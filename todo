Add FFs:
    - FF for forcing encryption
    - FF for writing auth credentials to ~/.aws/credentials (NOT A DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR)
      vs writing it into a ~/.aacli/session.json (DEFAULT)
    - FF for avoiding clearing out .aws/credentials upon session.json update.

Add run command:
    - User authenticates into an environment. File session.json is updated. File ~/.aws/credentials is cleared.
    - When 'run' command is invoked it decrypts the session.json, grabs credentials
      starts a subprocess via child_process.exec() and injects these variables through 'env' property.
      Hooks up process STDIN and STDOUT. OR even better separates from subprocess and exits to avoid
      holding pwd in memory.

Add a way to specify credential duration.
    - This ELIMINATES the need for the metadata server because the first session you assume can run up to 12 hours.
      It's only when you chain-hop it's restricted to 1 hour.

Readme:
    - Split for 2 groups of people: Devs that use it to setup local environment, and DevOps that use it to
      set it up for the organization everyone works for.
